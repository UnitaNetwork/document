# Unita Introduction

## What is Unita
Unita is an enterprise blockchain solution. It features high TPS (Transactions Per Second) and low transaction confirmation time, to make DApps (Decentralized Applications) applicable to more business scenarios. By using [SCAR](https://doc.unita.network/en/SCAR-Consensus/) (Scalable Consensus Algorithm), storage and network requirements are minimized to reduce operating costs. Unita development is based on the open-source [Qtum](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum) project, which is compatible with the Bitcoin UTXO data structure and Ethereum EVM using Solidity for smart contracts.

## Resource
Tools: [Homepage](https://unita.network), [Download](https://github.com/UnitaNetwork/unita/releases), [Stats](https://stats.unita.network), [Explorer](https://explorer.unita.network), [Faucet](https://faucet.unita.network), [One-click Blockchain](https://chain.unita.network).
